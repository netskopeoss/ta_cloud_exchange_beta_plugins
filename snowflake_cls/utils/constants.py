# there is no batch-size setting.

# as 'netskope_logs' is stored as 'NETSKOPE_LOGS'), but a table created
# quoted keeps whatever case it was given. Since every call this plugin
# makes quotes the name, the case typed here must be the exact case
# Snowflake stores the object under - which for an ordinary, unquoted
# CREATE TABLE is upper case, and for a quoted one is whatever was quoted.
# A mismatch is reported as "not found" at validate() time rather than
# rejected here, because this regex cannot know which case is correct for
# a name it has never looked up.
#
# Confirmed live (2026-10-07): the Snowpipe Streaming REST API resolves
# %22-quoted database/schema/table path segments case-sensitively, the
# same as a quoted SQL identifier - an unquoted segment 404s against a
